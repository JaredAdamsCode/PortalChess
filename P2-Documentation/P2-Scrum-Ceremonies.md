Need to setup sprint review meeting with PO soon - Ask PO if Thursday 10/01/2020 at 12:30pm will work

Questions for PO
If we are using another persons code for setting up the server/client what should we do to make sure they are given credit to avoid plagiarism?
Ask about getting shared machine for running the server/database in the CS department?

Talked about everyone running the spring react tutorial and learn how that functions so we can get the project fully started.

Meeting with PO

Should we setup another meeting with her for the planning phase? 
Not until we create all tasks and acceptance criteria for higher priority user stories, while creating these tasks any questions we run into make sure to make note of them for the planning meeting.

Sprint review should happen before the presentation for her to clear up issues with the presentation. Then with this feedback make changes to the presentation, and use this for the retrospective.

Development manual is where we give credit to any outside sources of code that we use. We are allowed to use what we found with spring/react, can't use outside logic code for implementing the chessgame for example.

Does project need to be live and deployed in a public environment? 
No she will need access to it for grading, she will let us know how she would like this done.

She is asking about getting a shared machine to use for setting up the server, she will get back to us on this.

Next Tuesday 10/06 we will create tasks and acceptance criteria for the high priority user stories, come up with questions for the PO, and schedule the planning meeting with the PO.

Questions for instructor
Do we need to create user stories/acceptance criteria/tasks for the additional features that were added in P2?
Do we need to create tasks for everything? Or just what we think we might get to in Sprint 2?
What are the expectations of where the project should be at the end of this Sprint?
What should we focus on first task wise?
How other teams are deploying the server? Running on a local machine vs a shared network machine
Check new user stories/acceptance criteria that were new to Sprint 2

Clarify invite system whether an invite to a game can only be accepted by one person, after that person accepts the invite then it goes away for everyone else
vs
Invite is sent to multiple people, any number of people can accept it, each accepted invite will start a new game
