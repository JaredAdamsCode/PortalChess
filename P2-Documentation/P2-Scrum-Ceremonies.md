Scrum Session 1
09/29/2020

Need to setup sprint review meeting with PO soon - Ask PO if Thursday 10/01/2020 at 12:30pm will work

Questions for PO
If we are using another persons code for setting up the server/client what should we do to make sure they are given credit to avoid plagiarism?
Ask about getting shared machine for running the server/database in the CS department?

Talked about everyone running the spring react tutorial and learn how that functions so we can get the project fully started.
