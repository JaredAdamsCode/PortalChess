Need to setup sprint review meeting with PO soon - Ask PO if Thursday 10/01/2020 at 12:30pm will work

Questions for PO
If we are using another persons code for setting up the server/client what should we do to make sure they are given credit to avoid plagiarism?
Ask about getting shared machine for running the server/database in the CS department?

Talked about everyone running the spring react tutorial and learn how that functions so we can get the project fully started.

Meeting with PO

Should we setup another meeting with her for the planning phase? 
Not until we create all tasks and acceptance criteria for higher priority user stories, while creating these tasks any questions we run into make sure to make note of them for the planning meeting.

Sprint review should happen before the presentation for her to clear up issues with the presentation. Then with this feedback make changes to the presentation, and use this for the retrospective.

Development manual is where we give credit to any outside sources of code that we use. We are allowed to use what we found with spring/react, can't use outside logic code for implementing the chessgame for example.

Does project need to be live and deployed in a public environment? 
No she will need access to it for grading, she will let us know how she would like this done.

She is asking about getting a shared machine to use for setting up the server, she will get back to us on this.

Next Tuesday 10/06 we will create tasks and acceptance criteria for the high priority user stories, come up with questions for the PO, and schedule the planning meeting with the PO.
