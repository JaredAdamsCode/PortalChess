Merged Jons' pull request for client sending invitation requests to server closed issue #34<br/>
Conor showed a demo sending invites to players and having it show up in their invitation list<br/>
- Need to work on players not being able to invite themselves
- Need a confirmation that the invite(s) were sent and then redirect back to dashboard
- Need to add a status to matches table to show whether a match has been accepted, rejected, abandoned, or pending
