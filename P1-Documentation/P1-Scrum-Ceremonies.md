## Scrum Session 1 Daily Scrum 09/10/2020

Github repository setup 

Create the repository  

Invite all team members to the repository 

Setup Zenhub within the repository 

 

Decided on major epics from account stories and created those in Zenhub 

Need a backend server, front end client, and database to store everything 

Split up account stories to then be created into a tasks, each going to add our tasks to Zenhub 

 

Discussed possible solutions that we may use for the project such as 

What the backend server might be, request/response server 

What the frontend might be using React or similar solution 

How both of these will communicate, possible api solutions 

 

Setup next meeting for Monday 09/14/2020 to finalize the tasks on Zenhub, so for next week we can meet with the PO to prioritize our tasks 

 

 

## Scrum Session 2 Daily Scrum 09/14/2020

Finalized tasks in the Zenhub board 

Discussed if we would like an actual GUI for the Client side and chess game vs command line 

Decided on GUI 

Meeting scheduled with product owner on 9/15 at 12:30pm to go through tasks 

Wrote down questions to bring up in tomorrow's meeting with the product owner 

Where should we deploy a server? Possible to use a CSU machine for this? Same for the database. 

Will the presentations scheduled be to the entire class, or just the product owners? 

Inviting product owners to meetings, should this be done through canvas? 

Should some of the tasks be broken down further into smaller tasks?

## Scrum Session 8  Sprint Retrospective 09/25/2020

What went well
Good meeting cadence, good attendance at meetings, easy to work with, easy to set up times for meetings
Started working on things early and worked on what we needed to regularly, very few days we weren't working on something
Everyone could work on a document all at once instead of one person doing everything
Everyone was easily able to express thoughts on the process 

What we need to work on
Ask more questions/ set up more meetings with Product Owner - some unclarity in parts of project
Be more attentive in telling everyone any update for the project even if it is small. Jared was left out of a team meeting because we decided to work right after class time.
